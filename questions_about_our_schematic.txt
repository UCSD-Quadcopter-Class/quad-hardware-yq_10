Meeting time: 12:00pm April 24th 2017 at Library Room 618

SCHEM:
1. No jumper present in the positive terminal of the battery
2. No pull-up resistors are placed from SCL/SDA to VDDIO
3. TX/RX pins are flipped on debug FTDI header (JP2)
4. SDO_M is shorted to ground, but it should be shorted to VDDIO
5. No custom LED circuit was created.
6. Motor circuit is wired to the IMU/uC ground. It should be wired to BAT_GND
7. The FLYBACK and FILTERED nodes on the motor circuit are all shorted together.
   Give all of them unique names to prevent this problem.

LBR:
1. It's recommended to give the part oultine in TPlace. [This is an issue for
   all designs]
2. NMOS pads are fine, but power dissipation might become an issue. Make them
   larger to give yourself some room.
