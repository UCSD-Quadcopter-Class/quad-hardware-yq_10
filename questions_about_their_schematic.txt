LED library
1. The size of pad is smaller than that suggested on the Page 8 in the datasheet.
2. The font of >NAME and >VALUE is in proportional instead of vector in the LED package.
3. R, G, B orientation signs in the package is placed in 49 tReference instead of 51 tDoc.

Lab 2 library
	
	LED
	1. The font of >NAME and >VALUE is in proportional instead of vector in the LED package.
	
	Resistor
	1. The font of >NAME and >VALUE is in proportional instead of vector in the LED package.
	
	IMU
	1. The first 'pad' is drawn by wire instead of pad (Fine).
	2. The font of >NAME is in proportional instead of vector in the LED package.
	
	MOSFET
	1. Pad 'D' is oversize (power dissipation).
	2. The font of >NAME is in proportional instead of vector in the LED package.
	3. Attribute in the device does not include 'value' item.
	
Schematic
1. The location of jumper and net bridge is opposite. Jumper is on the negative terminal and the net bridge is on the positive bridge.
