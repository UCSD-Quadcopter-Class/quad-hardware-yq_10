1. you've got a bunch of traces in BAT_GND on the top metal. 

2. GND should not be high_current net.  BAT_GND should be, though.

  Action: Change the net class of both GND and BAT_GND.

3. You need separate pours for GND and BAT_GND.  Just like you have separate pours for VCC and VBAT

  Action for 1 and 3: Draw BAT_GND at layer 15 right underneath VBAT.

4. C15 and C17 should be close to the balun and the wire to antenna.

  Action: Move both cap closer.

5. The trace from your jumuper to the positive batter terminal needs to be high_curren

  Action: Change the net class in the property.

6. your oscillator layout needs to be much closer to the microcontroller and match what's on the red board more closely.

7. More of your motor controller sould be laid out over the VBAT pour,  

  Action: Increase the size of VBAT and move components slightly.

8. The decoupling caps for the microcontroller are pretty far from the imu and microcontroller.

  Action for 6 and 8: Check the board layout of the redboard and move components accordingly.

9. your arms a little short.  some of your propellers are going tobe over your board.

  Action: Increase the length of arm by 7mm.

10. You have no reset button.

  Action: Check the schematic of the red board and use the button in the prebuilt library to be the reset button.

11. The package for your mosfet doesn't have large enough pads.  Check page 6 of the datasheet.

  Action: Edit the package and replace the part in the schematic with the new device in the library.

12. Be sure to get the new .dru and .cam files and reroute your board.

  Action: Download the new file from github.

13. the PWM lines do not need to be highcurrent.

  Action: Change the net class in the property.
