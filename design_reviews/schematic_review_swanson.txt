Several important pins on your IMU are not connected.  Read the table in then IMU datasheet about which pins do what.

missing pullups on SDA and SCL?

you could leave off the 10Ohm resistors on your blue LEDs.  Those LEDs will work fine at 3V.

you are missing the jumper between the positive battery terminal and VBAT. 

 The input cap on the voltage regulator should be on BAT_GND

GND symbols should always point down.

Flyback and Filtered are connecte across all your motor drivers.

filter cap in motor drivers should be 0.1uF instead of 1uF

THe decoupling caps on your motor drivers are labeled as 100uF but the parts are actually 220.
