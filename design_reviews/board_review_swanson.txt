commit e36eecbbd4657844361a1fecd752abddb1ab2ab0

you've got a bunch of traces in BAT_GND on the top metal.  

GND should not be high_current net.  BAT_GND should be, though.

You need separate pours for GND and BAT_GND.  Just like you have separate pours for VCC and VBAT

C15 and C17 should be close to the balun and the wire to antenna.

The trace from your jumuper to the positive batter terminal needs to be high_curren

your oscillator layout needs to be much closer to the microcontroller and match what's on the red board more closely.

More of your motor controller sould be laid out over the VBAT pour,  

The decoupling caps for the microcontroller are pretty far from the imu and microcontroller.

your arms a little short.  some of your propellers are going tobe over your board.

You have no reset button.

The package for your mosfet doesn't have large enough pads.  Check page 6 of the datasheet.

Be sure to get the new .dru and .cam files and reroute your board.

the PWM lines do not need to be highcurrent.
