Group 9 design review

Reviewer: Group 10

Antenna and Antenna Driver
	All check points are satisfied.
	
Power and Ground
	D8 is not above the VBAT power plane. There is a via near the motor driver.
	The 3V power plane is under the IMU and there is a ground via under the IMU.
	The VBAT power plane does not extend to the battery connector.
	
IMU
	3V plane is under the IMU.
	
Headers
	Headers are fine.
	
Microcontroller
	C1 is a little bit far.

Power Supply
	Power supply looks fine.

Motor Drivers
	Yes, the traces are thick enough. 

Aesthetics
	The board look nice.

Mechanical
	The cup is too big for the motor. The diameter should be 8.5mm. 
	It is roughly symmetric.
	No large internal holes.
Checks
	I did not find the DRU file from Group 9 and I used my DRU. There are errors related to stop mask and air wires.
	Eagle lint pass.
	DFM shows missing soldermask clearance as the potential steppers.

Gerber Files
	Antenna area is clear.
	Power planes are corresponding to the board layout.
	There is a motor cup showed on top and bottom copper layer. I am not sure is that correct.
	Outline is fine. 
	The stoppers are mentioned in 'CHECKS'.
