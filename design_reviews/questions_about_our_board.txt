Antenna and Antenna Driver
-- Balun -> Antenna trace should be thicker than the default trace width
-- Entirety of antenna is exposed to the ground plane. The ground plane should
   only reach the first trace [See the red board's layout]
-- Vias are surrounding the entire antenna [Should only surround the driver circuit]

Power and Ground
-- Traces seem to change width depending on the component they start from. [This is
   also a DRC complaint.]

IMU
| Some of the traces can be cleaned up, but otherwise fine
| Are you planning to control the quad in an X-layout?

Headers
- FTDI could possible have better information than just GRN/BLK identifiers

Microcontroller
| Oscillator trace lengths should generally be about the same (although it's not really "required")
-- Traces under the microcontroller are pretty crazy and wrap about each other!

Power Supply
- Could the caps C18/C19 be closer to the regulator?
| The area underneath the regulator is free. It could potentially be moved closer to the battery.

Motor Drivers
(Nothing wrong here)

Aesthetics
- Trace Layout looks very nice, with the exception of the traces under the microcontroller!
- Some of the placement references can be realigned such that they won't just be cut off
| Try using the silk to personalize the board! (Even a group name would suffice)!

Mechanical
- Battery placed in the lower half of the board! Board components are small, I doubt that 
   moving the battery to that location would be much better than leaving it in the center!

Checks
-- LED 5mm variant missing required attributes (Eagle Lint)
-- Can't find library 'Yueqi Wang-Lab 2' for LED on schematic (Eagle Lint)
-- There are a few critical clearance issues! [i.e. vias/traces too close to one
   another] Especiall so around the microcontroller! (DRC)
-- There are also a few overlap errors with the wires and vias around the microcontroller.
-- Some pins have different values and thus produce width errors (Are these intentional?
   Some don't seem like power lines.)

Gerber Files
[None were provided, so there were generated by Group 9.]
| Fills in the power plane looked almost like they were going to touch, but since Eagle didn't complain,
   I'll just leave this as more of a warning.
| A trace seems to overlap completely over a component (R8). Is this fine?
| The dashed lines seems to just be a reference. Is it fine to leave it in the dimensions layer?
   (It probably is fine, but I'm not quite sure either).
