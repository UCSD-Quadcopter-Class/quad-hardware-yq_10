The LED is selected based on the instruction in Lab4. The LED is selected from Digikey - discrete indication.

The datasheet is available at
https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/lite-on-inc/LTST-C193TBKT-5A/160-1827-1-ND/2355044

The datasheet is called LTST-C193TBKT-5A. 

A few concerns were considered when we selected the LED. First is the forward voltage. The voltage must be lower than 3V. So this standard 
filtered many out. Then, the mounting type was surface mount. Few less were left. More than that, we double checked that the price is 0.47
dollars for 1 LED and it was available for just 1 unit. Also, by checking datasheet of both microcontroller and LED, the current was fine.
Lastly, with the datasheet of the LED and the resistance calculation link provided on the course website, the resistance needed to pull up
the voltage drop to 3V was calculated as 10 Ohms, which was added into the schematic.

That is the basic design record for the LED we added into the schematic.
